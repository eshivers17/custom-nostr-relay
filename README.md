Here's a basic README.md file for your custom-nostr-relay project:
Custom Nostr Relay
Description

A custom Nostr relay implementation using the khatru framework, designed to filter events and reject submissions with prohibited content. Includes a test HTTP endpoint and sets the groundwork for future Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) integration.
Features

    Event content filtering with customizable banned words.
    HTTP endpoint for event submissions (/submit).
    Logging for rejected events.
    Future plans for TEE integration to secure content filtering.

Installation

    Clone the repository:

    bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/custom-nostr-relay.git
cd custom-nostr-relay

Install Go dependencies: Ensure Go is installed and set up properly:

bash

    go mod tidy

Usage

    Run the relay:

    bash

go run main.go

Test the endpoint: Submit an event using curl:

bash

    curl -X POST http://localhost:3335/submit -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"content": "Test event content"}'

Next Steps

    Add more advanced filtering logic.
    Implement user authentication.
    Integrate TEE for enhanced security.
